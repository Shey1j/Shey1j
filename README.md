I am a Front end Engineer with Bachelor's Degree in Computer Sciences from the University of Lagos. I am proficient in React, Next, Vue, Nuxt, a little bit of TypeScript. I have also dabbled in the use of different CSS frameworks, like Bootstrap, Styled Components and different libraries like Ant Design etc. I love to learn and try new things.
